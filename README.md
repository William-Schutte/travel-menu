# travel-menu
## William Schutte, 2020
A simple React page in the style of a restaurant menu for my many many travel plans.

Features:
* The regions selector buttons are generated automatically based on all regions present in the data.
* The sort buttons reorder the visible destinations by selected parameter (region is alphabetical).
